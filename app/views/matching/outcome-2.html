          You need to match identities with records

        <p class="govuk-body">
          You need to create a database of your service’s users.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Once you have a database, you can use the information provided by the certified companies to create new records for your users. Your service will then be able to recognise who they are next time they sign in.
        </p>

          Check if a user has already signed up to GOV.UK Verify
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Users can sometimes sign up for GOV.UK Verify more than once by creating accounts with different certified companies. Each certified company will give the user a different unique ID.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          This means a user with 2 accounts from different certified companies can sometimes look like 2 different people.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          You should check if the user has already signed up to GOV.UK Verify before you create a new record for them. If you don’t, you could create multiple records for the same user which will affect the overall quality of your data.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          To do this, you should look for a record that has the same unique ID you got from GOV.UK Verify. If you can’t find one, you should look for a record that matches their name, address and date of birth.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          If there are no matches, you can <a href="http://alphagov.github.io/rp-onboarding-tech-docs/pages/matching/createnewaccounts.html">create a new record</a> for that user.

          How to match identities with records
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          You must create a matching service to match verified identities with the records you've created. The matching service will also send the results to GOV.UK Verify.
