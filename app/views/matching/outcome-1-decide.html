          Decide how youâ€™ll match identities with records

        <p class="govuk-body">
          You need to decide how your service will match identities with records, as well as what counts as a successful match.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          You also need to decide what happens when:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>an identity is successfully matched to a record in your database</li>
          <li>an identity is matched to more than one record in your database</li>
          <li>no match is found</li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          It's possible an identity that's been verified by a certified company will be slightly different to a record in the database. You should also look for records that are a close match and decide what you'll do with them.

            <span>Example</span>
            Jonathan McDonald is successfully verified by a certified company. The service he wants to use tries to match this verified identity against a record in their database.</p>
            <p>The only record they find is for a Johnathan MacDonald. This is the same user, but the identity and record don't match because their name is spelt differently.</p>
            <p>There are often spelling mistakes in this particular database because the data is collected over the phone. The service applies <a href="http://alphagov.github.io/rp-onboarding-tech-docs/pages/matching/matchingstrategy.html#decide-rules-for-matching-and-confidence-scores">'fuzzy matching'</a> rules to decide Jonathan McDonald is the same person as the Johnathan MacDonald in the database.</p>
            <p>This match is successful and Jonathan McDonald can continue to use the service.
