        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Choose the right level of assurance</h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          You can choose how thorough you want your service's identity checks to be by picking a 'level of assurance'.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Which one you pick depends on how confident your service needs to be that a user is who they say they are.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          To help make your choice, you should think about:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            how many users will need to use your service
          </li>
          <li>
            how well-known your service is - popular services are more likely to be threatened or attacked
          </li>
          <li>
            how users will feel about using your service, for example will they be reluctant to use it or is there a chance they'd use it maliciously
          </li>
          <li>
            if your service will check any additional information about your user, for example if there's a record of them in an existing database
          </li>
          <li>
            if your service has been targeted by fraud or cyber crime in the past
          </li>
          <li>
            what would happen if a user impersonated someone else to use your service
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
          Level 1
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          You should use level 1 if:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            users can't use your service to claim benefits or payments
          </li>
          <li>
            your service will need to check other information about a user as well as their identity, such as their driving licence number
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          If your service also lets users update personal information about themselves then you might need level 2 instead.
        </p>

        <div class="panel govuk-body govuk-!-mb-r6 govuk-!-mt-r6">
          <p>
            <span>Example</span>
            The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) use level 1 in their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence">view driving licence information</a> service. This is because users can only get information from this service. They canâ€™t use it to apply for anything more valuable or change their details.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          It takes users an average of 5 minutes to prove their identity with level 1. They only need to do this once.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          They'll be asked a series of questions that only they know the answer to. They usually won't need to provide any additional documents.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
          Level 2
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          You should use level 2 if:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            your service gives users benefits, money or anything else valuable
          </li>
          <li>
            you need to able to take users to court if they fraudulently use your service
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="panel govuk-body govuk-!-mb-r6 govuk-!-mt-r6">
          <p>
            <span>Example</span>
            HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) use level 2 in their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return">file a Self Assessment tax return</a> service. This is because a user could be fined if someone else pretends to be them and uses this service to give false information to HMRC.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          It takes users an average of 15 minutes to prove their identity. They only need to do this once.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          They'll usually need at least one document (for example a driving licence or passport) to prove their identity. They might also need financial documents, such as a bank or credit card statement.
