        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Barclays was unable to verify your identity</h1>

        <p>There are a few reasons why this might happen, including:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>your answer to a question doesn't match records</li>
          <li>Barclays does not have access to enough information about you</li>
          <li>you've recently had a change in your circumstances, and they are not up to date online</li>
        </ul>
