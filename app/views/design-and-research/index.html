          You service should send users to GOV.UK Verify at the point you need to check their identity. For most services, this will be near the start of the user journey.

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How to let users choose which verification method to use</h3>

        <p>You might need to provide the user with a number of different methods to sign in. This can be helpful if users already have an existing account (Government Gateway for instance) preventing them from needing to create a second account. How this decision is presented to the user should be determined by a number of different factors:

        <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>which sign in methods are available to users</li>
          <li>how many users have existing accounts</li>
          <li>how regularly users sign back into the service</li>
          <li>how well the demographics of the service match those of  successful sign-ins</li>
          <li>the benefits of using one method over another within the service journey.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>See an <a href="example?bannerText=Example of how you should let users choose a verification method&guidanceText=&returnText=Return to Design your service&goBackURL=index&exampleURL=/design-and-research/verification-method">example of how you should let users choose a verification method</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to send users to GOV.UK Verify from your service</h2>
        <p>
          You should let your users know they’re leaving your service before you send them to GOV.UK Verify. GDS has created different design patterns to help you do this.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If users can sign in to your service in more than one way</h3>

        <p>
          Use the <a href="example?bannerText=Example of the multiple sign in page&guidanceText=&returnText=Return to Design your service&goBackURL=index&exampleURL=">multiple sign in page pattern</a> if there’s more than one way for users to sign in to your service. For example, users can sign in to some HM Revenue and Customs services with either GOV.UK Verify or Government Gateway.
