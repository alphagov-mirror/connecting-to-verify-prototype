        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Choose the right level of assurance</h1>

        <p>
          You must choose a level of assurance (LOA) for your service. Which one you pick depends on how confident your service needs to be that:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            a user is who they say they are
          </li>
          <li>
            the person they're claiming to be is real
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To help make your choice, you should think about:
        </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          what financial, physical or emotional damage could be done to a user if someone else impersonated them when using your service
        </li>
        <li>
          what users can get from your service, for example benefits or personal information
        </li>
        <li>
          how much money your organisation could lose or how much damage could be done to its reputation if your service is threatened or attacked
        </li>
        <li>
          how many users your service has and how well-known it is
        </li>
        <li>
          if your service has been targeted by fraud or cyber crime in the past
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
          LOA 1
        </h2>

        <p>
          LOA 1 is suitable for a large number of government services.
        </p>

        <div class="panel govuk-body govuk-!-mb-r6 govuk-!-mt-r6">
          <p>
            <span>Example</span>
            The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) use LOA 1 in their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence">view driving licence information</a> service. This is because the service lets users see information that isn’t sensitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a user impersonated someone else to use this service, they wouldn’t be able to use this information to do any harm to that person.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          If your service uses LOA 1, it will take users an average of 5 minutes to create an account with a certified company. They only need to do this once.
        </p>

        <p>
          After they've done this, it will take them less than a minute to sign in to your service.
        </p>

        <p>
          To create an account, they might be asked:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            a series of questions that only they know the answer to, like how much their monthly mortgage payments are or when they last took out a mobile phone contract
          </li>
          <li>
            to sign in to their online bank account
          </li>
          <li>
            to take a photo of themselves and an identity document, such as a driving licence
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
          LOA 2
        </h2>

        <p>
          LOA 2 will let you carry out more rigorous identity checks.
        </p>

        <p>
          LOA 2 might be suitable for your service if it:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            gives users money or benefits
          </li>
          <li>
            lets users update information about themselves or see sensitive information
          </li>

        <div class="panel govuk-body govuk-!-mb-r6 govuk-!-mt-r6">
          <p>
            <span>Example</span>
              The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) use LOA2 in their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-redundancy">claim for redundancy and monies owed</a> service. This is because users receive money from this service.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a user impersonated someone else to use this service, they could get money they're not entitled to. This could also stop the real user from being paid money they're owed.
          </p>
        </div>

          <p>
            If your service uses LOA 2, it will take users an average of 15 minutes to create an account with a certified company. They only need to do this once.
          </p>

          <p>
            After they've created an account, it will take them less than a minute to sign in to your service.
          </p>

          <p>
            They'll usually need at least 2 documents to create an account. These should be from either:
          </p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
              a government department, for example a passport
            </li>
            <li>
              a bank or building society, for example a credit or debit card
            </li>
