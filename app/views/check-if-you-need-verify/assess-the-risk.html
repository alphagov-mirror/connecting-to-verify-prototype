          Assess the risk of identity fraud to your service
        </h1>

        <p>
          GOV.UK Verify is designed to protect services and users from online identity fraud. It provides 2 different levels of assurance (LOAs) – LOA 1 and LOA 2.
        </p>

        <p>
          The higher the LOA, the more confident you can be that your users are who they say they are. Which LOA you choose depends on your assessment of the risk of online identity fraud to your service.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
          Carrying out a risk assessment
        </h2>

        <p>
          You should do an assessment to help you understand what makes your service more or less likely to be targeted by online identity fraud. Think about why your service needs identity assurance and the risks you are trying to protect against.
        </p>

        <p>
          You should focus on the risks associated with someone using a false identity or another person’s identity to access your service. This is different from eligibility, which is about whether users have the right to use your service (for example, users are only eligible to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-universal-credit">apply for Universal Credit</a> if they have less than £16,000 in savings).
        </p>

        <p>
          To carry out a risk assessment, you should:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>complete the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/8cqHClJlw8UH2raA3">identity risk questionnaire</a></li>
          <li>discuss the appropriate LOA for your service with the GOV.UK Verify team – they’ll get in touch with you after you complete the questionnaire</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When completing the questionnaire, you’ll need to think about:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>whether your service has been targeted by identity fraud or cyber crime in the past</li>
          <li>how much money your organisation could lose if your service is threatened or attacked</li>
          <li>how much damage could be done to your organisation’s reputation if your service is threatened or attacked</li>
          <li>what users can get from your service, for example benefits or personal information</li>
          <li>what financial, physical or emotional damage could be done to a user if someone else impersonated them when using your service</li>
        </ul>
