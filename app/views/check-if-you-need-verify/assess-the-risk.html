          Assess the risk of identity fraud to your service
        </h1>

        <p>
          GOV.UK Verify is designed to protect services and users from online identity fraud. It provides 2 different levels of assurance (LOAs) – LOA 1 and LOA 2.
        </p>

        <p>
          The higher the LOA, the more confident you can be that your users are who they say they are. You should do an assessment to understand how high the risk of identity fraud to your service is - this will help you choose the right LOA for your service.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
          Carrying out a risk assessment
        </h2>

        <p>
          Doing a risk assessment will help you understand the factors that could make your service more or less likely to be targeted by identity fraud. You should consider why your service needs identity assurance and the risks you are trying to protect against.
        </p>

        <p>
          You should focus on the risks associated with someone using a false identity or another person’s identity to access your service. This is different from the issues associated with eligibility, which is about whether users have the right to use your service (for example, users are only eligible to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-universal-credit">apply for Universal Credit</a> if they live in certain areas).
        </p>

        <p>
          To carry out a risk assessment, you should:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>complete the <a href="../public/downloads/identity-risk-questionnaire.pdf">identity risk questionnaire</a></li>
          <li>send the completed form to <a href="isf@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">isf@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a> - the GOV.UK Verify team can then discuss with you the appropriate LOA for your service</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When completing the questionnaire, you’ll need to think about:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>whether your service has been targeted by identity fraud or cyber crime in the past</li>
          <li>how much money your organisation could lose</li>
          <li>how much damage could be done to your organisation’s reputation if your service is threatened or attacked</li>
          <li>what users can get from your service, for example benefits or personal information</li>
          <li>what financial, physical or emotional damage could be done to a user if someone else impersonated them when using your service</li>
        </ul>
